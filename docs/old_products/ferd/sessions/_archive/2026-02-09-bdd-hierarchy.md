# Session: Documentation Restructuring - BDD Hierarchy

**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Version:** 0.2.10
**Focus:** Establish complete BDD hierarchy from Vision to Code

---

## 📝 Summary

Successfully established a complete Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) documentation hierarchy for FringeIsland. Created upstream documentation (Vision, Product Spec) that was missing, completed the TDD workflow guide, and updated all workflows to support the new structure.

**Key Achievement:** Project now has full traceability from "why we exist" (Vision) through "what we're building" (Product Spec) down to "how we verify it works" (Tests).

2. **`docs/planning/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`** - Product Specification
   - Defined v1.0 MVP scope explicitly
   - User personas (Sarah - learner, Marcus - leader)
   - Feature breakdown with acceptance criteria

## 💡 Decisions Made

### 1. Full BDD Hierarchy Implementation
**Decision:** Implement complete BDD flow from Vision to Code
**Rationale:**
- Behaviors were being written without upstream context
- Features existed but weren't linked to product vision
- AI agents needed to understand "why" not just "what"
- Future team members need full context

**Flow Established:**
```
Vision → Product Spec → Roadmap → Milestones → Features → Behaviors → Tests → Code
```

### 2. Vision Captures "Edutainment" Philosophy
**Decision:** Make edutainment (education + entertainment) explicit in vision
**Rationale:**
- Core differentiator for FringeIsland
- Guides all feature decisions
- Explains journey metaphor choice
- Connects to FringeIsland World

### 3. Product Spec Defines Clear v1.0 Scope
**Decision:** v1.0 = Basic journeys + groups (current Phase 1)
**Rationale:**
- Ship incrementally, validate with users
- Phase 1.5 (communication) can wait for user feedback
- Dynamic journeys (Phase 3) too ambitious for MVP
- Focus on proving journey metaphor works

### 4. TDD Workflow Shows Full Context
**Decision:** TDD workflow explains BDD hierarchy, not just testing
**Rationale:**
- Tests without behavior specs → incomplete
- Behaviors without feature context → confusing
- Features without vision → arbitrary
- Full context = better decisions

### 5. Boot-Up Verifies Feature Context
**Decision:** Before building features, verify they exist in Product Spec
**Rationale:**
- Prevents building undocumented features
- Ensures alignment with vision/scope
- Catches scope creep early
- Forces intentional feature decisions

### 6. Close-Down Updates Behavior Specs
**Decision:** Mark behaviors as "verified ✅" after testing
**Rationale:**
- Shows which behaviors have test coverage
- Links tests to behaviors to features
- Future sessions know what's validated
- Complete traceability

### Phase 1.4 Completion
- [ ] Journey content delivery (step-by-step navigation) - BUILD WITH TDD!
- [ ] Progress tracking for enrolled journeys
- [ ] Journey completion tracking

### Future Considerations
- [ ] Use Vision.md to guide feature prioritization decisions
- [ ] Update Product Spec after v1.0 launch based on user feedback
- [ ] Create feature docs for all major features (groups, roles, members)

## 📚 Context for Next Session

**What you need to know:**
- Vision and Product Spec now define upstream context
- TDD workflow shows full BDD hierarchy (not just testing)
- Boot-up now verifies features exist in Product Spec before building
- Close-down now updates behavior specs (mark as verified)
- All workflows aligned with new documentation structure

**When building next feature:**
1. Check Product Spec - is feature listed?
2. Check docs/features/ - does feature doc exist?
3. Follow TDD workflow - Vision → Spec → Roadmap → Feature → Behavior → Test → Code

**If uncertain about scope:**
- Read VISION.md - does this align with edutainment philosophy?
- Read PRODUCT_SPEC.md - is this in v1.0 scope?
- Read DEFERRED_DECISIONS.md - did we already decide to defer this?

**Useful docs:**
- `docs/VISION.md` - Why FringeIsland exists
- `docs/planning/PRODUCT_SPEC.md` - What we're building (v1.0)
- `docs/workflows/tdd-workflow.md` - How to build features with TDD
- `docs/workflows/boot-up.md` - How to start a session
- `docs/workflows/close-down.md` - How to end a session
