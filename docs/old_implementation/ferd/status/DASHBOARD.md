## 🔄 Updating the Dashboard

The dashboard reads files on page load. To see updates:
- **Refresh the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
- Updates appear immediately after markdown files are saved

## 💡 Usage Tips

### Daily Workflow
1. **Morning**: Open dashboard to see project status and priorities
2. **During work**: Keep it open in a pinned tab for quick reference
3. **Evening**: Check what was accomplished

### With AI Assistants
When you say "Boot up FringeIsland", the AI reads these same files. The dashboard gives you the same view the AI has!

### Team Collaboration
- Share your screen with dashboard open during pair programming
- Quick status updates without reading multiple files
- Visual progress tracking for stakeholders

## 🛠️ Customization

### Change Default Collapsed State
Edit `app/dev/dashboard/page.tsx` and change `defaultOpen` prop:
```tsx
<CollapsibleSection
  title="My Section"
  defaultOpen={false}  // Change to true/false
>
```

### Add New Sections
1. Create a parser in `lib/dashboard/parsers.ts`
2. Import it in `app/dev/dashboard/page.tsx`
3. Add a new `<CollapsibleSection>` with your data

### Modify Colors/Styling
The dashboard uses Tailwind CSS. Common classes:
- Background: `bg-gray-800`, `bg-blue-900/50`
- Text: `text-white`, `text-gray-400`
- Borders: `border-gray-700`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Dashboard won't load:**
- Ensure dev server is running (`npm run dev`)
- Check terminal for the correct port
- Verify no TypeScript errors

**Data looks wrong:**
- Check if markdown files are properly formatted
- Refresh the page (F5)
- Check browser console for errors

**Sections missing:**
