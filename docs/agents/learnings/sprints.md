## Entries

### 2026-02-13: Journal initialized
Sprint process established. Key insights from project history:
- XL tasks (like RBAC design) should be split across sessions with checkpoints
- Boot-up/close-down workflows prevent context loss between sessions
- Session bridges in docs/planning/sessions/ provide continuity
- MEMORY.md must stay under 150 lines (200-line system limit minus buffer)

→ Promoted to playbook? ✅ (all in Sprint Workflow + Scope Management)
