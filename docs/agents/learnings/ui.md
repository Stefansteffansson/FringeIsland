### 2026-02-13: Journal initialized
Starting point. Known patterns captured in playbook from prior sessions:
- Always use ConfirmModal, never browser alert()/confirm()
- Always show loading states during async operations
- Responsive design: mobile-first with sm:/md:/lg: breakpoints
- Empty states need helpful messages, not blank space
- ErrorBoundary wraps components; try/catch for async + event handlers

→ Promoted to playbook? ✅ (all in existing playbook)
