# Agent System

**Purpose:** Two-tier agent structure with continuous learning for AI-assisted development

## Architecture

Agents are organized in two tiers:

### Tier 1: Domain Agents (Knowledge + Execution)
These are your "hands" — they know how to build things in their domain.

| Agent | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Database** | [database-agent.md](./contexts/database-agent.md) | Schema, migrations, RLS, triggers, functions |
| **UI** | [ui-agent.md](./contexts/ui-agent.md) | Components, styling, UX patterns, accessibility |
| **Integration** | [integration-agent.md](./contexts/integration-agent.md) | Data flow, Supabase queries, state management |
| **Test** | [test-agent.md](./contexts/test-agent.md) | Behavior specs, test writing, coverage tracking |

### Tier 2: Process Agents (Thinking + Governance)
These are your "brain" — they think about what to build and whether it's good.

| Agent | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Architect** | [architect-agent.md](./contexts/architect-agent.md) | System design, schema evolution, technical decisions |
| **QA/Review** | [qa-agent.md](./contexts/qa-agent.md) | Code review, security audit, pattern compliance |
| **Sprint** | [sprint-agent.md](./contexts/sprint-agent.md) | Planning, retrospectives, knowledge curation |

### Legacy (Archived)
| Agent | File | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Feature** | [feature-agent.md](./contexts/archive/feature-agent.md) | Replaced by Integration Agent + workflows. Archived for reference. |

## How Agents Work Together

### Feature Development Flow (TDD — MANDATORY ORDER, SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION)

**⛔ RULE: One agent at a time. User approves each transition. No parallel agents during feature work.**

```
Sprint Agent: "Here's what we're building" (feature doc verified)
    |
    🛑 USER CHECKPOINT — "Feature doc ready. Proceed to behaviors?"
    |
Test Agent: "Here are the behavior specs" (B-XXX-NNN)
    |
    🛑 USER CHECKPOINT — "Behaviors documented. Proceed to tests?"
    |
Test Agent: "Here are the failing tests" (RED)
    |
    🛑 USER CHECKPOINT — "Tests failing (RED). Proceed to design?"
    |                    ← Tests MUST exist and FAIL before design/implementation
Architect Agent: "Here's the design" (informed by test scenarios)
    |
    🛑 USER CHECKPOINT — "Design complete. Proceed to implementation?"
    |
Database Agent → Integration Agent → UI Agent: "Built it" (GREEN)
    |
    🛑 USER CHECKPOINT — "All tests pass (GREEN). Proceed to review?"
    |
QA/Review Agent: "Reviewed — looks good" (or "fix these issues")
    |
    🛑 USER CHECKPOINT — "Review complete. Proceed to documentation?"
    |
Sprint Agent: "Update status, retrospective"
```

**CRITICAL:** The Test Agent runs BEFORE the Architect Agent for new features.
Tests drive the design, not the other way around. If tests pass immediately
after writing (before implementation), something is wrong.

**CRITICAL:** Sequential execution only — one agent at a time, user approves each
transition. Never launch parallel agents for feature work. Each checkpoint is a
conversation with the user, not an internal gate.

### Bug Fix Flow
```
Test Agent: "Failing test reproduces the bug" (RED)
    |
[Domain Agent]: "Fixed" (GREEN)
    |
QA/Review Agent: "Verified, no regressions"
```

## Continuous Learning System

Agents learn through a three-layer system:

### Layer 1: Playbooks (stable, curated)
The agent context files themselves. Contain **proven patterns** confirmed across multiple uses. Updated deliberately during Sprint retrospectives.

**Location:** `docs/agents/contexts/[agent].md`

### Layer 2: Journals (running, append-only)
Each agent has a companion learning log. Discoveries are appended during work. Low friction, fast capture.

**Location:** `docs/agents/learnings/[domain].md`

| Domain | Journal File |
|--------|-------------|
| Database | `learnings/database.md` |
| UI | `learnings/ui.md` |
| Integration | `learnings/integration.md` |
| Testing | `learnings/testing.md` |
| Architecture | `learnings/architecture.md` |
| QA | `learnings/qa.md` |
| Sprints | `learnings/sprints.md` |

### Layer 3: Collective Memory (cross-cutting index)
`MEMORY.md` in the Claude Code memory directory. Holds only cross-cutting rules that affect ALL agents. Hard cap: 150 lines.

### Learning Flow
```
During work:
  Discovery → Agent Journal (append)

Close-down workflow:
  "What did we learn?" → Relevant Agent Journal(s)
  Cross-cutting insight → MEMORY.md

Sprint retrospective:
  Review journals → Promote confirmed patterns to Playbooks
  Review MEMORY.md → Prune outdated entries
  Flag recurring issues → Update relevant agent's Known Pitfalls
```

### Journal Entry Format
```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD: [Short description]
[What happened, what was learned]
→ Promoted to playbook? [Not yet / Yes (date)]
```

### Promotion Criteria
A journal entry is promoted to a playbook when:
- Confirmed across **2+ separate uses** (not just one occurrence)
- Represents a **stable pattern** (not a one-off workaround)
- Would **prevent a mistake** if known upfront

## Agent Context Structure

Every agent playbook follows this structure:

```markdown
# [Agent Name] Context

## Identity          — Who am I? What do I care about?
## Quick Reference   — Key files, commands, numbers
## Boundaries        — What I do / don't do / hand off to
## [Domain Content]  — Patterns, checklists, examples
## Quality Gates     — How I know my work is done
## Known Pitfalls    — Common mistakes to avoid
## Learning Protocol — Journal location and update process
## Related Docs      — Links to detailed documentation
```

**Critical sections** that older agents may lack:
- **Boundaries** — Prevents agents from doing each other's work
- **Quality Gates** — Clear "definition of done"
- **Learning Protocol** — Connection to the journal system

## Which Agent to Load

| Work Type | Primary Agent | Also Load |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Database changes | Database | Architect (for design) |
| UI components | UI | Integration (for data) |
| Wiring data to UI | Integration | — |
| Writing tests | Test | Relevant domain agent |
| System design | Architect | Database (for schema) |
| Code review | QA/Review | — |
| Sprint planning | Sprint | — |
| New feature (full) | 1. Test (behaviors + RED tests) → 2. Architect (design) → 3. Domain agents | Sprint (planning) |
| Bug fix | Test first (reproduce), then domain agent | QA/Review (verify) |

**Rule:** Load 1-2 agents at a time, not all seven. Each agent's Boundaries section tells you when to hand off.

**Rule:** Sequential execution only — one agent at a time, user approves each transition. Never launch parallel agents for feature development work.
