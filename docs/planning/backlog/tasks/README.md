# Tasks

Individual task files with YAML frontmatter. Each task is a standalone work instruction assigned to a person or agent.

**Template:** [`../../../templates/task.md`](../../../templates/task.md)
**Naming:** `TASK-{NNN}.md` (e.g., `TASK-001.md`)

## Rules

- Tasks are created **only for features at maturity `4-ready` or higher**. Do NOT create tasks for features still being specified.
- One task = one focused agent session. If more than a day, split it.
- Each task references its parent feature in frontmatter (`feature: FEAT-{PREFIX}{NNN}`).

## Lifecycle

`created → in_progress → review → done → survives cooldown/retro → deleted after retrospective committed`

The retrospective is the permanent learning artifact; individual tasks are ephemeral and deleted once the retro captures their learnings.

_No active tasks._
