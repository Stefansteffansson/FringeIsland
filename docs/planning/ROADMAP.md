## Overview

FringeIsland development is organized into four major phases, each building on the previous:

- **Phase 1: Foundation** - Core platform with predefined journeys ⏳ **IN PROGRESS (83%)**
- **Phase 2: User-Generated Content** - Journey marketplace and customization

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Supabase limitations | Have migration plan to self-hosted PostgreSQL |
| Performance issues | Implement caching early, monitor closely |
| Complex authorization logic | Comprehensive tests, code reviews |
| RLS policy bugs | Test RLS policies thoroughly with different user contexts |

### Product Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Users don't create journeys | Provide excellent templates and examples |
| Low engagement | Build strong community features early |
| Feature creep | Strict scope discipline, validate before building |
| Poor journey quality | Curation and quality guidelines |

### Business Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Slow adoption | Focus on early evangelists, iterate quickly |
| Monetization challenges | Multiple revenue streams (not just paid journeys) |
| Competition | Differentiate on flexibility and collaboration |

## Current Development Focus (February 2026)

### Active Work (v0.2.13)
- ✅ Journey system complete (v0.2.11)
- ✅ Security hardening + behavior docs + role tests (v0.2.13)
- ✅ **RBAC system design complete** (22 decisions, D1-D22) — `docs/features/planned/dynamic-permissions-system.md`
- ⏳ Communication system (Phase 1.5 — NEXT)

### Next Sprint
**Priority 1**: Communication System (Phase 1.5)
- Group forums (post, reply, moderate)
- Direct messaging between users
- In-app notification system (also infrastructure for RBAC membership flows)
- Read/unread status

**Priority 2**: RBAC Implementation (after Phase 1.5 messaging)
- Schema evolution (group_type, group-to-group memberships, personal groups)
- `has_permission()` function + `usePermissions()` hook
- Migrate from `isLeader` to `hasPermission()`

### Blockers & Dependencies
- RBAC implementation depends on Phase 1.5 in-app messaging (D13: membership notifications)

### Technical Debt
- Add unit tests for critical paths
- Improve mobile responsiveness
- Add loading skeletons
- Implement error tracking (Sentry)

**Document Version**: 1.6
**Last Updated**: February 11, 2026 (RBAC design complete, Phase 1.5 priority elevated)
**Next Review**: After communication system complete or March 2026
