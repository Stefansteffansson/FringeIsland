# FringeIsland

An educational and training platform for personal development, leadership training, and team/organizational development.

## 🎯 Vision

## 🏛️ Core Concepts

### Journeys
Structured learning experiences that users can complete solo or collaboratively. Journeys are content templates that groups or individuals enroll in.

### Groups
Flexible organizational units (teams, companies, cohorts) with customizable membership and permissions. Groups can contain users and other groups ("member of" relationships).

### Roles & Permissions
Fine-grained authorization system with role templates and group-specific instances. Permissions are context-based and customizable per group.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16.1 (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with remote patterns
- **Deployment**: Vercel (planned)
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub
